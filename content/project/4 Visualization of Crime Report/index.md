# Overview
Our project's purpose is to provide insight into the relationship between age, race and crime. The data used for this project was collected in 2013 by the FBI and published by the Uniform Crime Report on their website. The main question we are attempting to answer through this app is whether or not a person's race and age would affect their likelihood of being arrested. This topic has been a major public controversy that has been debated upon for many years. The user can view data percentages for criminals from either all ages, those under 18 or those who are 18 and above through a pie chart and a bubble chart.

By choosing the age and race through the radio buttons, users could could get a pie chart that contain the selected information.

In the bubble chart, users could get a overall information about the Crime Report. The size of the bubble represents the population of certain race. Users could decide how many bubbles they want to see in the same char by sliding the slider in the sidebar.

Hopefully, by viewing the data in this app, the user will be able to conclude about the nature of the relationship between race and crime. Have Fun using this APP!

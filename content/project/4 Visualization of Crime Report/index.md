# Overview
This project's purpose is to provide insight into the relationship between age, race and crime. The data used for this project was collected in 2013 by the FBI and published by the Uniform Crime Report on their website. The main question we are attempting to answer through this app is whether or not a person's race and age would affect their likelihood of committing crimes. The visualization of crime report is important becuase it can provide insight on how to decrease crime rate in the future. The user can view data percentages for criminals from either all ages, those under 18 or those who are 18 and above through a pie chart and a bubble chart.

Hopefully, by viewing the data in this app, the user will be able to conclude about the nature of the relationship between race and crime. 

The link to the information we used:

* [the data of all the arrests in 2013]( https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43)

# Features
## Bubble Chart
In the bubble chart, users could get an overall information about the Crime Report. The size of the bubble represents the population of certain race. Users could decide how many bubbles they want to see in the same char by sliding the slider in the sidebar.

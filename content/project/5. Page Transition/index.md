This is a simple demonstration of animated transitions between pages. This project contains three cards with different themes. While the user drags right or left to view another card, both the presenting card and the card that's going to be presented will move along path and zoom in. The animated transition will give the flow of websites an extra touch of top-notch and smoothness. I used the inVision Studio to create this project.
